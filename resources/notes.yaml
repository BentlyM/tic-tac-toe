Some ground rules:
  1. modules should be self contained
    - everything to do with my module is in my module
    - little to no global variables
    - if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up to another method/function (single responsibility)
  2. separation of concerns
  - DRY code: Don't repeat Yourself
  - KISS: Keep it Simple Stupid
  - YAGNI: You Ain't Gonna Need It (don't over engineer)
  3. effect DOM/variable/property usage
    - if it looks reusable REUSE IT. (do not just create another call)
  4. no memory leaks
    - all events can be unbound

implementation strategy: 
- how do you want to implement this? (remember step at a time)
  - first -> i want to implement a grid to the container
    - the grid will have div's (for the x/o's)
    - the grid will have a nested flex to justify and align children
    - the grid will have a gap of some kind to distinguish tiles
  - second -> i want to add a board
    - the board should allow the player to choose if there going against a player or computer (not functional)
    - should display score (if rounds)
    - should include a play again button 
    - should display winner
  - third -> what i want to happen when a tile is clicked
    - when a tile is clicked i want it to display players x/o 

extra questions: 
  - how will you layout the grid?
    - i could directly insert it into html (not picked)
    - i could insert it threw javascript (picked)
  - should the player be able to decide if there noughts or crosses?
    - decision: no;
